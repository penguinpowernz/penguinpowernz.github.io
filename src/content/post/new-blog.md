So I got a new blog now, got it up and running with hugo, a static site generator written
in Golang.  Pretty good so far.

Got a new machine at work the other day.  It's pretty sweet.  It's got a Core i7-6700 CPU,
16 GB of DDR4 RAM and I put the R7 270 from my old beast in it.  Running four screens
on GNOMEbuntu 16 and have two RAID arrays; one with 2 blocks of melted sand in RAID0 (1GB/s
yeeee) and another with 2 disks of spinning rust in RAID1.  The melted sand is
snapshotted to the spinning rust every hour using backintime.  It's pretty sick.
